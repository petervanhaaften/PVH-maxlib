UPDATES:

1) Fixed all the weird ratio/manual mode switching bugs (I think!)

2) Added Sine --> Square sweeping. Like on the 258, there is a switch to change from Sine --> Saw and Sine --> Square modes, but we could change that to a single knob with square on left, sine in middle, saw on right if you need.

3) Made simple help file.

4) Changed to 16X oversampling (uses 30% of one core on my 2012 mbpro. . .). I couldn't get the "up X" messages into poly~ to work. . .

TO DO (in order if importance):

1) Allow all parameters to be controlled by signals. Should be easy but I've not done that with Jamoma yet & need to dig into the docs.

2) The modulator osc index seems to  fade in too fast when set to Sine --> Square mode. Not sure what's up with that, but it could be an issue with the knob exponential factor?

3) Generally improve responsiveness of the sliders (especially Carrier freq and Modulator freq sliders).

4) Wavefolding seems to cause a slight amplitude bump. . .

5) Make poly~ oversampling variable.

6) Improve noise filtering, right now the modulator noise osc is low passed filtered with the cutoff set automatically as a ratio of the fundamental carrier frequency. Might be more useful with a slider or number box.

7) Fix the scope so it auto scales to show a clear single (or maybe few) cycles of the oscillator. I've seen this kind of scope scaling functionality in your nav.scale~ object.

8) Improve & finalize help file.
